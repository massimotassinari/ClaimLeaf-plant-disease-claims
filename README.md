## Problem Statement  
Early-stage plant diseases significantly impact agricultural productivity, especially in crops like tomatoes, potatoes, and bell peppers. Detecting these diseases early can prevent major losses.

## Our Solution  
Using transfer learning and fine-tuning on a pre-trained image classification model, we developed a deep learning solution to automatically detect and classify diseases in crop leaves from images.

This enables early detection and proper treatment of diseases!
